# Express/Passport Lecture Starting File
Download and run 'npm install' before the lecture as prep. In this lecture, we will build out a user registration page and allow our users to log into our application. Once they are logged in, we will see information returned to us, specific to the user.

Assignment: After the lecture, add first name, last name, and email to the schema and the registration form. Append this information to the DOM when the user logs in.
